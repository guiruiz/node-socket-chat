## Socket Web Chat

### About
I made this project to learn more about NodeJS native modules and client-server real time communications.

### To Do
- Add support for nicknames.
- Implement React
- Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects.
- Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it himself. Instead, append the message directly as soon as he presses enter.
- Add “{user} is typing” functionality.
- Show who’s online.
- Add private messaging.
- Implement a Node.js native module (C++) to encode messages (Caesar Cipher?)
- Persist messages on a NoSQL database
