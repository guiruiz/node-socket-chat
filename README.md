## Socket Web Chat

### About
I made this project to learn more about NodeJS native modules and client-server real time communications.

### To Do
- Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects.
- Add support for nicknames.
- Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it himself. Instead, append the message directly as soon as he presses enter.
- Add “{user} is typing” functionality.
- Show who’s online.
- Add private messaging.
- Implement end to end encryption (RSA secret key exchange) https://gist.github.com/guiruiz/0909e8a91982e0937cf665952cd346b3 
- Find a reason to implement a Node.js native module (C++) 
- Persist messages on a NoSQL database
- Implement React
